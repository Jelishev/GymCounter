# GymCounter

This is just a small android app intended to be used at the gym.

It will have:
- A countdown timer and stopwatch
- A rep reminder and in-between-set rest timer
- A weekly egg consumption counter with conversions to various micro and macro nutrient figures

It would be nice to have:
- Trackers or graphs for different workouts
- Customizable color schemes (main feature)
- Customizable layouts
- Lets users change the text of any element on the main screen of the app
